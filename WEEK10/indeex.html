<p>A few quotes and ideas I though were funny or important:</p>
<div>
</div>


<p>
           “Womb to tomb surveillance“.       </p>

<div>
</div>
<p>

“Conflict between out needs for privacy and the community needs to know”
</p>

<div>
</div>

<p>
No erase of early mistakes
</p>
<div>
</div>

“Electric circuitry has overthrown the
regime of "time" and "space" and pours
upon us instantly and continuously the
concerns of all other men”

<div>
</div>


“Politics offers yesterday's
answers to today's questions.”

<div>
</div>


I agree, the current way school is structured is like an assembly line factory or an office

<div>
</div>

Computers will take over specialized and repetitive jobs

I always thought it was interesting to hear an intergenerational perspective on technology. Having grown up in the instant gratification computer age I can’t imagine not having any show I wanted, information I needed, or person I wanted to talk to instantly on demand. I really believe as humans we are being rewired by our current pervasive technology. But I feel like  intergenerational adults are the most affected by technological and societal changes. I feel like a lot of the younger generation would have or use analog tech for nostalgic value or out of curiosity. But because older adults have lived in a time when that was the only option, new inventions (that were created to supply their demand)  seem more essential.  A huge problem is that technology can become so universal. Its not like a movement you can opt out of or ignore. If you don’t have a computer, smartphone,  or social media account, you are going to be living in a totally different time than anyone else. You are going to be at a huge disadvantage in daily life.

I found the “others” interesting because it is the opposite of what seems to be happening in today’s politics. After watching the Vice presidential debate, I was taken aback by how VP Pence made a few statements that blatantly alienated some minority groups.  //By not acknowledging how many people were killed by COVID due to the President’s incompetence, by stating that systemic racism was basically not real, and other concerning statements// But this reading triggered me to realized that the Trump administration can afford to be racist, misogynistic, and homophobic and only appeal to a certain group of Americans and still be successful. I thought politicians were supposed to appeal to as many groups at the could - minorities included - to be successful.</p>
