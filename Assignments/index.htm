<h1>Response to Berger's "Ways of Seeing"</h1>

I thought the evolution of the oil painting to color photography advertisements might be influenced by how the meaning of a piece of media can be distorted. When Berger was talking about how we used to go and see a painting in a location like a church, and how the meaning of the art was tied to that place it struck me as something that made a lot of sense. A painting is made for a specific audience, like he talked about in Episode two. A collector, a landowner, a worshipper, all looked at paintings from different perspectives, and interpreted different things from it.

But in Episode four when we Berger talked about how ads are now framed by our lives they seem to lose some effectiveness. Our brains have to suspend disbelief to believe something is true. When we see an ad for luxury handbags next to a homeless person, or ads for alcohol or lingering on the bus next to kids coming home from school, it takes you out of the moment. It's hard to buy into the life of the ad when it sharply contrasts with reality.

Now with ads being targeted it seems like we are trying to return to the tradition of media being more stationary and appealing to an audience. Websites are constantly tracking us, trying to predict what we will want next. After visiting Amazon and looking for dog treats, I saw ads for the same treats I was looking at pop up on Facebook, Instagram, and other sites I visited that day. When I did a Google search to research types of popup campers, I started seeing images of tents on the margins of online forums.

But like when paintings are stationary, each person will not be seeing the same thing. When I use my mom or step dads computers, I see ads for car parts, tea, and insurance. When I help my brother with homework his ads are for toys, and video games. We are again receiving media that matches the audience it is intended for.

I would have liked him to spend more time on the exploration of paintings used for symbolism vs paintings used to display wealth. The painting of the Dutch woman or nude paintings that were not designed for the viewer seem like subtle challenges to the tradition of painting. On the surface they seem to say one thing, but anyone with the ability to look deeper and interpret can see past what is obvious. The same is true with advertisements.

I was surprised he did not talk much about physical advertisements or works of art that often. It seems as if people have moved away from depicting “ideal” forms through sculpture, and a lot of contemporary sculpture is abstract. Also showrooms, for example Ikea or Crate and Barrel, seem to be persuasive in selling the idea of the perfect home. As you walk around the store, you imagine if you buy this one piece of furniture, one organizing item, your home can be one of envy.
